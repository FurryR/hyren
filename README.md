## ü§î How to use

1. üîΩ Download hyren daily build from [`Github Actions`](https://github.com/FurryR/hyren/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) (**requires login**). Please always download latest commit. You can download either `hyren-debug` or `hyren-release`. Decompress the artifact into a folder.

2. üê∫ Open the artifact in browser and your `Tampermonkey` / `ViolentMonkey` will automatically detect it as an userscript. Click `Install`.

3. üéâ Done!

## üõ†Ô∏è Compatibility

Usually you can use hyren to boost most projects, but there are always some exceptions.

1. When using Turbowarp based editor (including Turbowarp itself), I get an error that prevents me from start your project.
   > This is because the native compiler conflicts with hyren. Disable hyren may work.
2. When using Gandi IDE, I randomly get some error but the project works fine.
   > Just ignore these errors, your project is running fine. Hyren will fallback to interpreter when compilation fails, so it may affect performance.
3. I use Microsoft Edge. I used hyren but it didn't boost a lot.
   > Turn off Edge's "Enhanced security mode". It disables the browser's JIT so it is extremely slow.
4. Other errors.
   > Well, hyren is just an experimental project. Disable hyren may work, but you can't enjoy compiler anymore.
